* Installation

** What do you need?

If you're DE user, you might want to select what you need from =tasksel=, since it iss also possible to install some tools from here also. you might want to use this to your advantage, choose with =space= and after you're done, press =enter=.

#+begin_src shell
$ sudo tasksel
#+end_src

Some tools if you choose to use WM, here I use I3 for convenience purpose, but you can also use =xmonad= or =qtile=.

#+begin_src shell
$ sudo apt install \
    spice-vdagent spice-webdavd \
    htop \
    neofetch emacs neovim \
    cmake libtool libtool-bin\

$ sudo bash -c 'echo "set bell-style none" >> /etc/inputrc'
#+end_src
